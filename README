Collaborative chatterbot project.

Kicked off at the Clojure Meetup on 2011-07-07.


For now, agreement is that an input map with key :input is processed,
and map with key :output is produced


Some interesting directions for this project:

- Look for the answer using a search engine, an api (wolfram alpha),
- ask a human (eg as a gateway to mturk)
- ask a dataset (Crunchbase, Factual)
- translation

- introspection and learning for what responders/templates work and what do not

- handling failures (logging out eg responder or template errors)

- services tiers
- support for distributed society of elizas
- scoring of responses

hook it up to a voice rec service:
